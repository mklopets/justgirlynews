#### Grabs headlines with images from http://www.postimees.ee and turns them into elegant justgirlythings-esque masterpieces

**justgirlynews** uses [PHP Simple HTML DOM Parser](http://simplehtmldom.sourceforge.net/) to scrape the contents of the website for headlines and cover images as its [RSS feed](www.postimees.ee/rss/) only provided `50px*50px` thumbnails.

The article images are used as background images and are then applied multiple several CSS3 filters and a semi opaque blue layer.

The filters used here were inspired by [a post by Nick Georgiou](http://designpieces.com/2014/09/instagram-filters-css3-effects/).
